Adept Software Development Kit (SDK) for Linux Change Log
=========================================================

Adept SDK for Linux v2.3.1 (04/19/2013):
	1. The following modifications were made to the include files:
		dpcdecl.h
			- The definitions of the following symbols were changed from
			  "const DWORD" to "#define": cchAliasMax, cchUsrNameMax,
			  cchProdNameMax, cchSnMax, cchVersionMax, cchDvcNameMax,
			  cchDtpStringMax, cchErcMax, cchErcMsgMax. This allows these
			  symbols to be used as initializers in C applications.
			- The definition of the "hifInvalid" symbol was changed from
			  "const HIF" to "#define" so that this symbol may be used as
			  an intializer in C applications.
			- The definition of dcapJtag was changed from
			  "const DCAP dcapJtag = dcapJtg;" to
			  "const DCAP dcapJtag = 0x00000001;" to prevent C applications
			  from failing to compile.
			
	2. Changed Makefile syntax to prevent compilation errors that were
	   occuring in newer Linux distributions.

Adept SDK for Linux v2.2.1 (12/19/2012):
	1. The following modifications were made to the include files:

			- added definition of batch property bits:
			  djbpWaitUs, and djbpSetAuxReset
			- added definition of batch commands
			- added declaration of functions used for performing batch
			  transactions: DjtgBatch, and DjtgGetBatchProperties
